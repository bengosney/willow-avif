# Willow AVIF

This is a plugin for Willow to enable AVIF support.
It uses [pillow-avif-plugin](https://github.com/fdintino/pillow-avif-plugin) to enable AVIF support in pillow.

## Note on Willow support
While Willow now supports avif via pillow-heif, pillow-heif requires libheif and the pillow-avif-plugin doesn't so, for me at least, this still needs to exist.
